U-Net Image Segmentation
This project implements a U-Net model for image segmentation using TensorFlow and Keras. It is designed to process grayscale images in TIFF format, applying data augmentation techniques to enhance the training dataset.

Features
Load images from a specified directory structure.
Normalize and augment images for improved model performance.
Define and compile a nested U-Net architecture.
Train the model with a simple training loop.
Requirements
Python 3.x
TensorFlow
OpenCV
NumPy
scikit-learn
Acknowledgments
TensorFlow and Keras for the deep learning framework.
OpenCV for image processing functionalities.
